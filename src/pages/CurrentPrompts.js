    <h3> Now accepting submissions for Issue No. 4 (Due July 27th) </h3>
    <h3><strong>The Masquerade</strong></h3>
    <p>Shimmering braziers line the portico, lively music spills forth from the windows and permeates the grounds, and guests adorned with exotic masks flow through the colonnade. Vibrantly colored tapestries line the halls in which acrobatic performers dazzle the onlookers with feats of grace and daring. The party pulses with a primal vital force, as the elaborate regalia strain to contain a more feral power. Sophistication and frenzy, duplicity and truth: though surely it is unsustainable, it is far too late to slow down now, so please, join us: you are cordially invited to The Masquerade.  </p>
